# Classification Model: ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix

This project involves building and evaluating a binary classification model using the `ABC` model (e.g., `AdaBoostClassifier` or any other classifier). The evaluation of the model is done using metrics such as the **ROC curve** and the **Confusion Matrix**, which are visualized through plots.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on the following tasks:
1. **Training a classification model** using a dataset with features (`x_train`, `x_test`) and labels (`y_train`, `y_test`).
2. **Plotting the ROC curve** to visualize the model's performance in terms of True Positive Rate (TPR) vs. False Positive Rate (FPR).
3. **Creating a Confusion Matrix** to evaluate True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives in the model's predictions.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
pandas (optional if required for data processing)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to evaluate a classification model using both ROC curves and confusion matrices. The ROC curve provides insight into the model's ability to distinguish between the classes, while the confusion matrix gives a detailed breakdown of the classification results.
